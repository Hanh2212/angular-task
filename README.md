## High level design

### Application architecture
### Simple data interaction flow
## Features
### Angular application and simple Nest API
- [x] Easy to understand project structure
- [x] Simple CRUD list and its tasks
- [x] Filter tasks by status

While working with this application, I have the opportunity to revisit some of the interesting topics:
- Deploy Angular application to Netlify, Nestjs to Heroku

## Setting up development environment
- `git clone https://github.com/Hanh2212/angular-task.git`
- `npm install`
- `npm start` for angular web application
- The app should run on `http://localhost:4200`


This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.2.5.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
